The counter is very intuitive to use. 
You can increment the value with the `plus` button and you can use the `less` button to decrement it. If you need to count a very high figure, you can add a value equal to ten using the `plus ten` button or subtract the same value with the `less ten` button.
When you want start again just use `Reset` button.

You can storage all the value you need using the `M` button

By doing so, it will give you the date and time the value was saved. And when you don't need it anymore, you just click on the `trush` button.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts:

- `plus` = `Right Arrow`
- `less` = `Left Arrow`
- `plus ten` = `Shift` + `Right Arrow`
- `less ten` = `Shift` + `Left Arrow`
- `Reset` = `Backspace`
- `M` = `M key`
